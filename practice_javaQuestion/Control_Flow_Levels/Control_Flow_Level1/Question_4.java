//Write a program to check for the natural number and write the sum of n natural numbers

//A Natural Number is a positive integer (1,2,3, etc) sometimes with the inclusion of 0
//A sum of n natural numbers is n * (n+1) / 2 
//I/P => number
//O/P => If the number is a positive integer then the output is
//The sum of ___ natural numbers is ___
//Otherwise 
//The number ___ is not a natural number

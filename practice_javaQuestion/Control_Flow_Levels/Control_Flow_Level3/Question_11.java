//Write a program DayOfWeek that takes a date as input and prints the day of the week that the date falls on. 
//Your program should take three command-line arguments: m (month), d (day), and y (year). For m use 1 for January, 2 for February, 
//and so forth. For output print 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, and so forth. Use the following formulas, for the Gregorian 
//calendar (where / denotes integer division):

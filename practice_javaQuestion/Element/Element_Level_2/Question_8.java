//Write an IntOperation program by taking a, b, and c as input values and print the following integer operations a + b *c, a * b + c, c + a / b, and a % b + c. Please also understand the precedence of the operators. 
//Hint => 
//Create variables a, b, and c of int data type.
//Take user input for a, b, and c.
//Compute 3 integer operations and assign the result to a variable
//Finally, print the result and try to understand operator precedence.
//I/P => fee, discountPrecent
//O/P => The results of Int Operations are ___, ___, and ___
//Similarly, write the DoubleOpt program by taking double values and doing the same operations.
